For this project I was tasked to create a social media application and I could choose the design and the topic. I chose to create a page for book lovers and named it BookBlend. This is a social media application for all the book lovers who want to share their passion and thoughts on books.

## Description

This was en extension of another project where the main focus was to add JavaScript and make the site usable. I had to add more pages to the project as well as a bit of styling to get the whole project up and running.

I used a Trello board to keep track of the tasks for this project.
